# Counter App

## Overview
The Counter App is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to increment a count by clicking a button and save the current count to a list of previous entries. This project serves as a learning tool for understanding the basics of JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

## Features
- Increment a counter by clicking a button.
- Save the current count to a list of previous entries.
- Reset the counter after saving.
- Responsive design with a blurred background effect.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
